      <div class="row">
        <h2>What would be needed for Overcast to has Survival Games?</h2>
        <p><strong>Overcast</strong> is very original with their gamemodes so if they were to add Survival Games there would have to be some sort of an original twist added to the minigame.</p>
        <p><strong><i>Code</i></strong></p>
        <p>When it would come to the code there wouldn't be that much of a change from the existing PGM features with the XML code maps need. The only thing that would need coding would be the randomized chests. Everything else could already be done with the use of XML. Taking a random generated normal Minecraft map as the field here. The only change would be PGM generating (with the help of an XML module like < randomchests >on</ randomchests > or something like that) the random chest loot that would be pre-set with XML code (< randomchestsloot >< item >iron boots</ item ></ randomchestsloot > or something like that). The playing field could be marked with XML regions and same goes for different map features. You could allow breaking of some stuff to give it more of a Hunger Games feel so you could craft weapons and create traps. You could have some areas be marked of with a note "You are close to _____. Find it and take advantage of it!". The maps could also have a map in the players inventories so they know where people are and if they are close to a border (could also be done with the regional alerts things in XML). But thats up to the map makers to mess with if they want it or not.</p>
        <p>Now going back theres not that much difference from other Survival Games servers so what would make it different? Neat little features like sponsors. Observers would be allowed to purchase small items for the people playing. The items would be purchased with raindrops and would be given to the selected person. The items could be small healing potions (as health regen would probably be off) or food items that don't give too much but still give enough hunger points. That would require more coding but the developers could do it as they are very good at what they do.</p>
        <p>As for the traps that I was speaking about something neat that would be done with code is if a player places down a wooden pressure plate (as a trap) the plugin would see it (because XML could have something like <survivalgames/> in it to tell the plugin whats playing) and the plate would act differently. If a person steped on it then the trap would activate and possibly the played would get slowness or other potion effects.</p>
        <p>So these are all little things that would make it original so Overcast would stand out from other servers and get players to actually play the game. Now to the maps.</p>
        <p><strong><i>Maps</i></strong></p>
        <p>Overcast has a great way of selecting maps through Map Developers. Same as with any other map the community would make maps for the gamemode but there would be some limits to what map makers can do. There would be a set player limit and a set size for the map (aprox. 1000 blocks in radius or something).</p>
        <p>But what would make the maps special? Being innovative. Custom trees you can climb, holes you can hide in, "natural disasters" coded in XML (flood would rain water blocks on an area etc. that would be randomly done with spawers so not the whole map is flooded). There would be areas that would have some more loot but would also be a lot more open. Having animals as wild life in forestly maps so you can hunt for food etc. would really turn a twist on the maps. The maps would be original in the aesthetical way but also in the gameplay so there would not be a server with the same maps and how they work. There could be supply drops (XML) with bonus loot and such.</p>
        <p><strong><i>Gameplay</i></strong></p>
        <p>Most of the gameplay features have been noted above. But lets see how it would go. Start would be pretty standard, you get loot and then set traps, hunt or whatever you chose to do. However there would be a time limit and at the end the border would start closing in. By that if you are caught in the border and not going to the center you would start taking damage slowly if you wouldn't move and at the end, could also die. At the end the border would stop shrinking when it reaches a radius of 50 (example) around the middle of the map. At that point you would be there with the other players and it would turn into a deathmatch of some sort to see who is the winner.</p>
        <p><strong></i>Website</i><strong></p>
        <p>The website would need to be changed on players profiles to support this so you could actually see who won. The kills and deaths would be in their own special database so it would not affect kills and deaths from the existing gamemodes.</p>
        <p>There could also be some sort of achievements for killing an amount of players or winning so many matches. Those could under the trophies tab but would have a header saying "Survival Games Achievements". The icons would be the same but would not have the text under them. If you mouse over them the text would say what the objective is but the icons would be smaller than the trophies. If you achieved it, it would be the same as the current trophy icons but if you would not have the achievement yet the icon would have the opacity changed or crossed out.</p>
